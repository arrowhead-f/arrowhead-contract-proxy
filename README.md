# The Eclipse Arrowhead Contract Proxy System

This repository contains the documentaiton for and an implementation of the Contract Proxy system.
The system is useful for managing digital legal contracts, such as for deliveries, payments or licensing, between distinct stakeholders represented by their own local clouds.
In particular, the system takes responsibility for digital signing and publishing contractual events via the Eclipse Arrowhead Event Publish service.

The source code for the Contract Proxy system implementation is available in the [`contract-proxy/`](contract-proxy) folder, while its documentation is in the [`documentation/`](documentation) folder.
An example of how the system can be used is available in the [`contract-proxy-example/`](contract-proxy-example) folder.

The system is currently to be regarded as a prototype and exists primarily for the sake of allowing the Contract Proxy specifications to be refined.
